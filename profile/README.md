## ⚡ What Is a Speed Hack in Fall Guys?

A **Fall Guys speed hack** is a cheat that increases your in-game movement speed beyond normal limits. Whether it’s *2x*, *4x*, or completely insane *10x mode*, speed hacks let you skip obstacles, dodge grabs, and cross finish lines before anyone else knows what happened.

It’s the perfect blend of trolling and winning — especially in race-type maps and slime eliminators.
